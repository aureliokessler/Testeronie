# Testeroni

This is a Unity project in which I deal with collecting, interactions, animations, input system “New” and Cinemachine.

## What you can do in this game:
* Collect coins

###  Game Controlls:
* Move the Player with wasd and arrow keys.
* Move Keys + Left Shift: To Run.
* Space Key: To Jump
* E Key: To Interact (Currently no GameObjects to interact with it.)

## What's bugy:
* Movement: Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. `ThirdPersonController.cs` is from an older [Unity Starter Asset](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/starter-assets-thirdperson-updates-in-new-charactercontroller-pa-196526).
